Description of various options that used at bellow


"number_of_shards": "4",
set number of maximum number of primary_shards.
if this number BIGGER than actual logical data nodes,
primary_shards's number will set as number of data nodes.
and data nodes increases, number of primary_shards will increase until it become same to
original setting number (4 in this case)

"number_of_replicas": "3"
set number of maximum number of replica_shards.
if this number BIGGER than actual logical (data nodes - 1),
replica_shards's number will set as number of (data nodes - 1).
and data nodes increases, number of replica_shards will increase until it become same to
original setting number (3 in this case)

"merge.scheduler.max_thread_count": "1"
The maximum number of threads on a single shard that may be merging at once.
Defaults to Math.max(1, Math.min(4, Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() / 2))
which works well for a good solid-state-disk (SSD).
If your index is on spinning platter drives instead, decrease this to 1.
